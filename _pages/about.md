I am a researcher in cosmology, my main tools are simulations and machine learning, that I try to use to better understande our Universe. Currently I am postdoc in the Laboratory of Astrophysics at EPFL, in the beautiful city of Lausanne, facing the Alps across the Leman lake. My topic here is non-CDM simulations accelerated with ML tools.

Before that, I did my PhD in Paris, in the CEA institute. There, I worked on cosmology with galaxy clusters. I trained ML models to model X-ray properties of clusters and accelerate cosmological simulations, leveraging simulation-based inference for cluster number counts analyses. I also studied the future ATHENA telescope and forecasted cosmological constraints yielded by ATHENA-based surveys.
