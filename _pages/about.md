### Postdoc @EPFL

I am a researcher in cosmology. My main tools are simulations and machine learning, that I try to use to better understand our Universe. Currently I am postdoc in the Laboratory of Astrophysics at EPFL, in the beautiful city of Lausanne, facing the Alps across the Leman lake. I work on Dark Matter simulations with kolmogorov-arnold neural networks. I also study the impact of satellites on radio telescopes, in particular in the ocntext of SKA. Finally, I also participated to the SKA Data Challenge 3b with the SEarCH team, in order to infer the history of reionization from SKA mock observations.

Before that, I did my PhD in Paris, in the CEA institute. There, I worked on cosmology with galaxy clusters. I trained ML models to model X-ray properties of clusters and accelerate cosmological simulations, leveraging simulation-based inference for cluster number counts analyses. I also studied the future ATHENA telescope and forecasted cosmological constraints that ATHENA-based surveys could provides.
