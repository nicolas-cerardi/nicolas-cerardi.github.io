My new article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01820">Bypassing scaling relations with Lagrangian Deep Learning and Simulation-based inference</a> has been accepted in A&A and will be published soon ! It presents a new method to model cluster number counts, using cosmological simulations and ML.

We developped a fast field-level emulator powered by [JaxPM](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/JaxPM) and [Lagrangian Deep Learning](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2020324118) to produce cluster catalogs. The model is calibrated on [CAMELS](https://camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) simulations and allows We then used implicit inference to obtain contours on the cosmology and the astrophysics. Here below are mock X-ray maps generated by the pipeline
