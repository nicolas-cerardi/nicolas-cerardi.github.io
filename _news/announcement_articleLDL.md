My new article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01820">Bypassing scaling relations with Lagrangian Deep Learning and Simulation-based inference</a> has been accepted in A&A and will be published soon ! It presents a new method to model cluster number counts, using cosmological simulations and ML.
