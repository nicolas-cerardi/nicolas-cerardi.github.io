	abstract = {We present the first application of an artificial neural network trained through a deep reinforcement learning agent to perform active flow control. It is shown that, in a two-dimensional simulation of the K√°rm√°n vortex street at moderate Reynolds number (ùëÖùëí=100Re=100Re=100), our artificial neural network is able to learn an active control strategy from experimenting with the mass flow rates of two jets on the sides of a cylinder. By interacting with the unsteady wake, the artificial neural network successfully stabilizes the vortex alley and reduces drag by approximately 8¬†\%. This is performed while using small mass flow rates for the actuation, of the order of 0.5¬†\% of the mass flow rate intersecting the cylinder cross-section once a new pseudo-periodic shedding regime is found. This opens the way to a new class of methods for performing active flow control.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} X-ray observations of galaxy clusters are impacted by the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a manner that is challenging to quantify, leading to biases in the detection and measurement of cluster properties for both astrophysics and cosmological applications.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We detect and characterise clusters contaminated by central AGNs within the XXL survey footprint and provide a systematic assessment of the cosmological impact of such systems in X-ray cluster samples.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We introduce a new automated class for AGN-contaminated (AC) clusters in the XXL source detection pipeline. The majority of these systems are otherwise missed by current X-ray cluster-detection methods. The AC selection is also effective in distinguishing AGN and cool-core presence using supplementary optical and infrared information.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present 33 AC objects, including 25 clusters in the redshift range, 0.14 ‚â§ {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ‚â§ 1.03, and eight other sources with significantly peaked central profiles based on X-ray observations. Six of these are new confirmed clusters. We computed the missed fraction of the XXL survey, which is defined as the fraction of genuine clusters that are undetected due to their centrally peaked X-ray profiles. We report seven undetected AC clusters above {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 0.6, in the range where X-ray cluster detection efficiency drops significantly. The missed fraction is estimated to be at the level of 5\% for the 50 square-degree XXL area. The impact on cosmological estimates from missed clusters is negligible for XXL, but it produces a tension of ‚àº3{\textless}i{\textgreater}œÉ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} with the fiducial cosmology when considering larger survey areas.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This work demonstrates the first systematic attempt to quantify the percentage of missed clusters in X-ray surveys as a result of central AGN contamination. Looking towards surveys such as eROSITA and Athena, larger areas and increased sensitivity will significantly enhance cluster detection, and therefore robust methods for characterising AGN contamination will be crucial for precise cluster cosmology, particularly in the redshift {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 1 regime.},
