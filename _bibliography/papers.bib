	abstract = {We present the first application of an artificial neural network trained through a deep reinforcement learning agent to perform active flow control. It is shown that, in a two-dimensional simulation of the K√°rm√°n vortex street at moderate Reynolds number (ùëÖùëí=100Re=100Re=100), our artificial neural network is able to learn an active control strategy from experimenting with the mass flow rates of two jets on the sides of a cylinder. By interacting with the unsteady wake, the artificial neural network successfully stabilizes the vortex alley and reduces drag by approximately 8¬†\%. This is performed while using small mass flow rates for the actuation, of the order of 0.5¬†\% of the mass flow rate intersecting the cylinder cross-section once a new pseudo-periodic shedding regime is found. This opens the way to a new class of methods for performing active flow control.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} X-ray observations of galaxy clusters are impacted by the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a manner that is challenging to quantify, leading to biases in the detection and measurement of cluster properties for both astrophysics and cosmological applications.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We detect and characterise clusters contaminated by central AGNs within the XXL survey footprint and provide a systematic assessment of the cosmological impact of such systems in X-ray cluster samples.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We introduce a new automated class for AGN-contaminated (AC) clusters in the XXL source detection pipeline. The majority of these systems are otherwise missed by current X-ray cluster-detection methods. The AC selection is also effective in distinguishing AGN and cool-core presence using supplementary optical and infrared information.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present 33 AC objects, including 25 clusters in the redshift range, 0.14 ‚â§ {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ‚â§ 1.03, and eight other sources with significantly peaked central profiles based on X-ray observations. Six of these are new confirmed clusters. We computed the missed fraction of the XXL survey, which is defined as the fraction of genuine clusters that are undetected due to their centrally peaked X-ray profiles. We report seven undetected AC clusters above {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 0.6, in the range where X-ray cluster detection efficiency drops significantly. The missed fraction is estimated to be at the level of 5\% for the 50 square-degree XXL area. The impact on cosmological estimates from missed clusters is negligible for XXL, but it produces a tension of ‚àº3{\textless}i{\textgreater}œÉ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} with the fiducial cosmology when considering larger survey areas.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This work demonstrates the first systematic attempt to quantify the percentage of missed clusters in X-ray surveys as a result of central AGN contamination. Looking towards surveys such as eROSITA and Athena, larger areas and increased sensitivity will significantly enhance cluster detection, and therefore robust methods for characterising AGN contamination will be crucial for precise cluster cosmology, particularly in the redshift {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 1 regime.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Cosmological studies have now entered Stage IV according to the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) prescription. New missions ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Euclid{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Rubin{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Observatory, SRG/eROSITA) will cover very large fractions of the sky with unprecedented depth. These are expected to provide the required ultimate accuracy in the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS), which is required for the elucidation of the origin of the acceleration of cosmic expansion. However, none of these projects have the power to systematically unveil the galaxy cluster population in the 1 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 2 range. There therefore remains the need for an {\textless}i{\textgreater}Athena{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-like mission to run independent cosmological investigations and scrutinise the consistency between the results from the 0 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 1 and 1 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 2 epochs.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We study the constraints on the DE EoS and on primordial non-gaussanities for typical X-ray cluster surveys executed by a generic {\textless}i{\textgreater}Athena{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-like Wide Field Imager. We focus on the impact of cluster number counts in the 1 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 2 range.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We consider two survey designs: 50 deg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} at 80 ks (survey A) and 200 deg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} at 20 ks (survey B). We analytically derive cluster number counts and predict the cosmological potential of the corresponding samples, A and B, by means of a Fisher analysis. We adopt an approach that forward models the observed properties of the cluster population in the redshift‚Äìcount rate‚Äìhardness ratio parameter space.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The achieved depth allows us to unveil the halo mass function down to the group scale out to {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2. We predict the detection of thousands of clusters down to a few 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}‚àí1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}‚äô{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, in particular 940 and 1400 clusters for surveys A and B, respectively, at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 1. Such samples will allow a detailed modelling of the evolution of cluster physics along with a standalone cosmological analysis. Our results suggest that survey B has the optimal design as it provides greater statistics. Remarkably, high-redshift clusters represent 15\% or less of the full samples but contribute at a much higher level to the cosmological accuracy: by alleviating various degeneracies, these objects allow a significant reduction of the uncertainty on the cosmological parameters: Œî{\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}a{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is reduced by a factor of ‚àº2.3 and Œî {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}NL{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}loc{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} by a factor of ‚àº3.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Inventorying the deep high-{\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} X-ray cluster population can play a crucial role in ensuring overall cosmological consistency.

	abstract = {The number density of galaxy clusters across mass and redshift has been established as a powerful cosmological probe. Cosmological analyses with galaxy clusters traditionally employ scaling relations. However, many challenges arise from this approach as the scaling relations are highly scattered, may be ill-calibrated, depend on the cosmology, and contain many nuisance parameters with low physical significance. In this paper, we use a simulation-based inference method utilizing artificial neural networks to optimally extract cosmological information from a shallow X-ray survey of galaxy clusters, solely using count rates (CR), hardness ratios (HR), and redshifts. This procedure enables us to conduct likelihood-free inference of cosmological parameters \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$. We analytically generate simulations of galaxy cluster distribution in a CR, HR space in multiple redshift bins based on totally random combinations of cosmological and scaling relation parameters. We train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to retrieve the cosmological parameters from these simulations. We then use neural density estimation (NDE) neural networks to predict the posterior probability distribution of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ given an input galaxy cluster sample. The 1 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ errors of our density estimator on one of the target testing simulations are 1000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$: 15.2\% for \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}\$ and 10.0\% for \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$; 10000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$: 9.6\% for \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}\$ and 5.6\% for \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$. We also compare our results with Fisher analysis. We demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that it is possible to calculate cosmological predictions of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ from a galaxy cluster population without explicitly computing cluster masses and even, the scaling relation coefficients, thus avoiding potential biases resulting from such a procedure.
